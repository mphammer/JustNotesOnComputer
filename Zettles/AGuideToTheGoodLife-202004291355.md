# Key Ideas

## Philosophy of Life
* Philosophy of Life = Grand Goal of Living + Strategy to Obtain Your Grand Goal of Living
* If you don’t have one then you might “...look back and realize that you wasted your one chance at living. Instead of spending your life pursuing something genuinely valuable, you squandered it because you allowed yourself to be distracted by the various baubles life has to offer” (2)
* Stoicism is not for everyone. People should choose a Philosophy of Life based on their personality/circumstances. However, following one is better than not following one at all. 

### Grand Goal of Living
* The goal that we should be unwilling to sacrifice to attain other goals
* What in life is worth pursuing
* People’s Default Grand Goal of Living (bad): Spend one’s days seeking an interesting mix of affluence, social status, and pleasure

### Strategies to Obtain your Grand Goal of Living
* What in life is worth pursuing and how to obtain it
